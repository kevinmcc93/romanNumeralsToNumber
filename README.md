# romanNumeralsToNumber
JS file which converts roman numerals into numbers

In my node enviroment (v16.14.2), I ran this file via 'node romanToNumber.js' in the terminal. 
This outputs some examples which are logged at the bottom of the file.

Alternatively you can test this by pasting the romanToNumber function into your browser's console, 
and then call the function with a roman numeral value e.g. 'romanToNumber("MCMXVII")' to see the result.
